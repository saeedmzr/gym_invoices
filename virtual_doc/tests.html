                    <p>
                        Invoice records are unique for user-club. for example if you check-in at 2 different clubs in a month, you got 2 invoice records.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If a user check-in with no credits in his membership account, he should check-in but he will check-in as a GUEST.

                    <p>
                        In this test we want to test a user that check-in as a club. first, we create a club and check in at it with a user 4 times. then we test the invoice amount should equal to cost_per_check_in from that club multiply 4.                    </p>
                </li>

                            style="color:#3ff53f">invoice total amount should return exactly what we except for membership:</span></p>

                    <p>
                        If a user check-in with only membership status, then in the invoice amount would be equal to zero since he doesn't have to pay anything
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="ml-5 mt-4">

                            style="color:#3ff53f">invoice total amount should return exactly what we except for membership if it ends between:</span></p>

                    <p>
                        One of the most challenging parts of the product is when the user check-in with both statuses: membership and guest. for example, imagine a user has 2 credits in his membership account .then he can check-in 2 times with that.
                        after that he wants to check-in 2 more times .but he doesn't have any credits left. the amount of invoice in this scenario should be the club's cost per check-in multiply 2.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="ml-5 mt-4">

                            style="color:#3ff53f">invoice get created again if month passes:</span></p>

                    <p>
                        If you check-in after a month in any club then you have 2 records in the invoices table.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="ml-5 mt-4">

                    <p>
                        You can't check in at a certain club twice a day.
